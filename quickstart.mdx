## Get started in three steps

Connect your platform to Targeter and start creating campaigns for your clients.

### Step 1: Receive your issued API credentials

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="key" title="Partner credential issuance">
        As a trusted third-party partner, you will receive API credentials from Targeter:
        - **API Key**: Your unique partner identifier issued by Targeter
        - **API Secret**: Your secure authentication secret issued by Targeter
        
        These credentials are required for all API requests and are only provided to approved partners.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Understand authentication">
        Targeter uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for third-party partners:
        1. Exchange your issued API credentials for a JWT token
        2. Include the token in the `Authorization` header for all requests
        3. Tokens expire after 1 hour for security
        
        <Tip>Always store your issued API secret securely and never expose it in client-side code. These credentials are for server-to-server communication only.</Tip>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Make your first integration call

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Authenticate with your issued credentials">
    Start by obtaining a JWT token using your partner credentials:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://storhaug.targeter.tech/api/auth/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "api_key": "YOUR_ISSUED_API_KEY",
    "api_secret": "YOUR_ISSUED_API_SECRET"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600
}
```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="bullseye" title="Create a campaign for your client">
    Now create a campaign on behalf of your client using your JWT token:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://storhaug.targeter.tech/api/campaign" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "material": ["https://client-assets.com/property.jpg"],
      "name": "Client Property Campaign",
      "reference_id": "CLIENT-PROP-001",
      "target_url": "https://client-site.com/property/001"
    }
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
    "campaign_link": "https://storhaug.targeter.tech/campaigns?create=true&source_id=CLIENT-PROP-001"
}
```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
